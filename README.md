# hello-world
this is for informatics fundamental. 
I am excited to be learning more about ways to expand my current IT knnowledge. I just recently particiapted in a coding bootcamp and we used github. I am pretty familiar with the platform. While in the bootcamp I was pregnant with my second child and now have two under two. They are a big reason as to why I decided to go into IT.
